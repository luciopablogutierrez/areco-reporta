# **App Name**: CiudadConecta

## Core Features:

- Issue Reporting: Enable citizens to report urban issues with geolocation, photos, and real-time tracking.
- Interactive Map: Provide a map-based interface using Leaflet.js to display reported issues, allowing users to filter by category and status.
- Report Management (Citizen View): Implement a system for citizens to view and manage their submitted reports, including status updates and municipal comments.
- Administrative Panel: Enable administrators to view and manage reports, assign them to operators, and update statuses with mandatory comments. Provide charts of the incoming report rates per geographic regions, enabling adminstrators to send focused messages about municipal services during unusually high report rate conditions. Employ a tool to check whether the message relates to city services, like rubbish collection.
- Notification System: Enable notifications for status changes, comments, and nearby reports using Firebase Cloud Messaging and email.
- Social Engagement: Implement social features like commenting, upvoting, and sharing reports on social media.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, civic-minded blue (#2E9AFE) to represent trust and reliability in the app, without literally referencing Argentina's flag.
- Background color: A light, desaturated blue (#E6F7FF) to provide a clean and calming backdrop.
- Accent color: A contrasting orange (#FF9933) for calls to action and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, modern, neutral feel across all text elements.
- Use consistent, clear icons from Lucide-React to represent categories and statuses, enhancing usability.
- Maintain a clean, card-based layout, especially in lists and dashboards, with ample spacing to improve readability and focus.
- Implement subtle animations, such as fading transitions, to provide smooth and engaging user feedback during interactions.
